Adapter Pattern
***************

Makes two incompatible interfaces compatible.

:Implementation example:
 Abstract but running example of the Adapter Pattern implemented with
 the internal dictionary of a class instead of the traditional implementation
 based on inheritance (Kasampalis 2015, chapter "4. The Adapter pattern",
 subchapter "Implementation").

:Implementation example:
 Existing class does calculate a persons age dependent on the birthday
 date as string input. Adapter class uses the existing class but provides an
 interface which expects the birthday date in the datetime format (Phillips 2010,
 section "Adapter pattern" / p. 257).
